<h1>The Green Sand Beach</h1>

<hr />

<p>Green Sand Beach, also known as Papak≈çlea Beach, is one of only four green
sand beaches in the entire world. Located near the southern tip of the Big
Island of Hawaii, it gets its distinctive olive-green color from a mineral
called olivine, found in the surrounding volcanic cone. The beach is nestled
in a rugged bay, carved into the side of an ancient cinder cone called Pu'u
Mahana.

To reach it, visitors must hike about 2.5 miles across lava fields and
windswept terrain, making the journey part of the adventure. The shoreline is
small but breathtaking, with sparkling green grains contrasting against the
deep blue Pacific Ocean. Swimming can be dangerous due to strong currents, so
caution is advised. Despite its remote location, the beach draws curious
travelers for its rare beauty and geological uniqueness. It's a truly magical
place where nature shows off its most unexpected colors.</p>
