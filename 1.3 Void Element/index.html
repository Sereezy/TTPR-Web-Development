<h1>The Green Sand Beach</h1>

<p>Green Sand Beach, also known as Papak≈çlea Beach, is one of only four green<br />
sand beaches in the entire world. Located near the southern tip of the Big<br />
Island of Hawaii, it gets its distinctive olive-green color from a mineral<br />
called olivine, found in the surrounding volcanic cone. The beach is nestled<br />
in a rugged bay, carved into the side of an ancient cinder cone called Pu'u
Mahana.</p>

<p>To reach it, visitors must hike about 2.5 miles across lava fields and<br />
windswept terrain, making the journey part of the adventure. The shoreline is<br />
small but breathtaking, with sparkling green grains contrasting against the<br />
deep blue Pacific Ocean. Swimming can be dangerous due to strong currents, so<br />
caution is advised. Despite its remote location, the beach draws curious<br />
travelers for its rare beauty and geological uniqueness. It's a truly magical<br />
place where nature shows off its most unexpected colors.</p>
