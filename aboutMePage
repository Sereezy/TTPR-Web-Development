<p> i want to code because honestly in this day and age theres technology everywhere and not learning about somehting that can benefit me into the furture of technology is so old times. i want to make websites and digital artto showcase my thoughts and ideas in my head.I enjoy solving problems and building things from scratch. 
    Coding gives me the opportunity to be creative while also being analytical </p>
    <h2>What I Hope to Get Out of This Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>
        I hope to gain a strong foundation in software development, collaborate on real-world projects, 
        and become confident in my ability to contribute to a development team. I also want to build 
        a portfolio that shows what I can do and helps me get a job in tech.
