<p>I am studying development because I want to build
     real solutions that can improve people's lives
      and shape the future through technology. I've always
       been curious about how websites, apps, and software
        work, and learning development gives me the tools 
        to turn ideas into reality. By gaining these skills, 
        I hope to open new career opportunities, solve 
        real-world problems, and contribute to projects that
         matter. This journey is not just about a jobâ€”it's 
         about becoming a creator in the digital world.</p>
