 <h1>About Me - May Aung</h1> 
 <p>
  I am interested in coding because I want to build aesthetic, user-friendly websites, web applications and applications.
  Before I learnt how to use vim, I loved coding after I got the result what I want -- website so far. 
  Now after I started using vim, I love the experience of coding.
 </p>
 <p>What I wanna achieve from TTPR is networking, a consistency, and a coding habit. I want to work on my weaknesses and encourage my strength and be ready for work.</p>
 <p>I am really hoping to make many friends as well.</p>
