<h1> About Nadia </h1>
<p>
    I want to code to become good at it. I want to do things automattically rather having to think 
    at every step. I'm hoping this bootcamp is more hands-on and provides real world examples of programming.
    I also want to experience what it's like working in a programming environment.
