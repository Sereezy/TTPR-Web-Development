Coding has always been in my life, the interest sparking mainly from games
which sparked me to make attempts to create my own games around the age 14, then the interest would develop to something more serious around 16.
Learned a lot about the basic concepts, and much deeper concepts such as E.C.S, Modules/Sub-Routines, how to create replications and etcera
decided to undertake the major of Cyber-Security because that connected with what I did in my earlier days of playing games (exploting)

Hopefully I gain more skills that aren't limited to simply Cyber-Security, so I can have the ability to use all of this information for my own personal projects in the future
alongside with this, having some solid guidance for what to do long-term going forward would be ideal.
