<p>I want to learn to code so I can hopefully get a tech job in New York since I like coding and
    being able to work and the work is something you like to do, it can help boost someones mood 
    while they work at their job.

    What I hope to get out of this bootcamp is some insight of what companies use in their everyday work 
    enviorment and what I can do with the technology they use. I hope that I can end this bootcamp strong and show 
    a strong understanding of what we will learn over the summer.
