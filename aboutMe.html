I'm currently a sophomore at City Tech currently majoring in Computer Systems with an interest in Software Engineering. I love 
learning new things and also love finding solutions to current problems that people are experiencing. I like the coding ascept of 
creating a website or apps because it is challenging and I like to face challenges and working through the difficult part and learning
from it. 

What I hope to get out of this bootcamp is learning how to use technology that I have not use before and to learn all I can about working 
team mates and working through the challenges that may arrise and learning from each one of them. I would like to learn more about different
programming languages and Softwares and how they all work together.
