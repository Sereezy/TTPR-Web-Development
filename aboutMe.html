<h1>About Me - Arisa M</h1>
<h3>Why do I want to code? What do I hope to get out of this bootcamp?</h1>
<p>I want to code to become a software engineer! Personally, I've always had an interest in coding and find that it cracks a part of my brain that I love: it's challenging and consistently prompts me to always improve. With this bootcamp, I'm looking to expierence what it's like to be apart of a tech-related work environment. I would say I'm fairly early in my career and this, to me, is a perfect segway into breaking out of my comfort zone with programming and collaborating with others.</p>
