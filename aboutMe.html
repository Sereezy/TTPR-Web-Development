Hi. I've been dabbling with CS and coding for years, but the true reasoning behind my drive, is because I love the idea
of learning something every day, while actively going on a run for MORE MONEY! I do hope to sharpen my skills and greatly
impact my field in Data Science. Coding, to me, is more than just writing programsâ€”it's about creating systems that make 
life easier, smarter, and more connected. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, structuring clean solutions, and delivering 
tools that others can actually use. That mindset, paired with my experience in data-driven projects, has shaped how I approach 
development: with intention, practicality, and a deep curiosity for how things work.
