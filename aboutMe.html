I want to code because it is something that I find interesting and love to do.
1. I want to get out of this bootcamp is a better understanding on coding languages and how they connect.
2. I want a better grasp on how my future career as a software developer will be and how the office/job might do.
3. I would like to get a better sense on group work/projects as that might be common in the future.
