  Hello I want to learn how to code better and create full stack sites. I am
  familiar with html and css, but want to get better at javascript. I like
  coding because i find it challenging and the reward of completing a tough
  project is great. What i hope to get from this bootcamp is the experience to
  make full stack sites and get a internship to graduate with my bachelors.
