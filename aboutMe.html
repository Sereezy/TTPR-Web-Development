    <p>
        Games have been the major reason why I want to code.
        I hope to publish my very own game out in the world 
        by the time I graduate. What I hope to get out of this 
        bootcamp is to expand my list of option in computer 
        science, as well as getting professional view on how 
        things work in the real world.
