    <title>About Me</title>

    <p> The reason why I want to code is because I love the way coding brings out the different 
        aspects and features of websites, not only that, but the way I can be creative on how I want 
        my own website to be attractive, interactive, and effective to those that want to use it. 
    </p>

    <p> What I'm looking forward to getting out of this bootcamp is becoming a better communitative 
        person when networking with new people and working in a team, get a better understanding of 
        how to code and how to use it to my advantage when it comes to creating websites and projects, 
        and to be able to use the skills I learn in this bootcamp to help me in my future career.
