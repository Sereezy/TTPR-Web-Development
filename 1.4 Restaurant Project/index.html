<h1>My Favorite Restaurants in New York</h1>

<h3>Bamontes</h3>
<p>This is an old school Italian restaurant in the heart of Williamsburg. 
    Best seafood dishes with a classic vibe. 
</p>
<h3>Cafe Evergreen</h3>
<p>
    A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side. Most 
    delicious soup dumplings I have ever had. 
</p>
<h3>Cheesecake Factory</h3>
<p>
    A place that has a little bit of everything, even the bread 
    is to die for.
