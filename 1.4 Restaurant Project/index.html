<h3>Mimisa</h3>
<p>This is a Korean Fried Chicken spot located in Flushing. They have multiple variations of the chicken along with other Korean sides. </p>

<h3>Olive Garden</h3>
<p>This resturant is known for its pasta and breadsticks. (The breadsticks are yummy.)</p>

<h3>Juju's Cafe & Deli</h3>
<p>This is a small cafe in Downtown Brooklyn. I normally go there for their onigiri's whenever I'm up for a walk.</p>
