<p>Write why you want to code and what you hope to get out of this bootcamp.</p> <br>
<p>I want to code because I love to test my problem-solving abilities. I enjoy the 
challenge of breaking down complex problems into manageable steps. Coding empowers me to 
build things that can make a real difference like automating tasks, creating applications, 
or contributing to new technologies. The tech industry is constantly evolving, and I want 
to be part of it while I continuously learn and adapt to new tools and trends. 

From this bootcamp, I hope to gain a strong foundation in coding that will help me transition 
into a career as a developer. I want to sharpen my technical skills, learn best practices, and 
work on real-world projects that prepare me for the challenges of the industry. Beyond just 
technical knowledge, I hope to collaborate with peers, build a professional network, and
develop the confidence to tackle coding problems independently. This experience is my stepping 
stone toward a fulfilling and dynamic career
   in software development.</p>
