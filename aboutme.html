My name is Norm Miller and I am Data Science major at CUNY's New York City College of Technology, located in Downtown Brooklyn. I have
always been fastinated with technology. I always wanted to learn how it functions in our world. I was estatic when I signed up to be a 
data science major. Personally, I already have basic computer operational skills. From the New York City Tech Pipeline this summer, I want
to enhance my coding skills and learn on how to be a better at coding.
