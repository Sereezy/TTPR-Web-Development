<h1>Local Man Saves Cat from Tree</h1>
<h2>written by John Smith</h2>
<h4>June 6, 2025</h4>
<h5>A loud meow echoed through the quiet neighborhood as a small orange cat clung nervously to a high tree branch. John, a passing jogger, 
    spotted the frightened animal and immediately sprang into action. With careful footing and a steady grip,
    he climbed the tree and gently coaxed the cat into his arms. Neighbors gathered below,
    cheering as John safely descended with the cat nestled against his chest. The cat's grateful owner tearfully thanked him, 
    calling John a true everyday hero.</h5>
