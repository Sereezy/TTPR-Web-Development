<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Cheesecake Layer:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li>
  <li>Prepare graham cracker crust by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar. Stir well. Add melted butter and mix with a fork until well combined.</li>
  <li>Press the crust mixture firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9” springform pan. Set aside.</li>
  <li>In a stand mixer or large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth (avoid over-beating).</li>
  <li>Add sugar and beat until creamy.</li>
  <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix well, scraping down the sides as needed.</li>
  <li>Gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, mixing on low until just incorporated. Do not over-mix.</li>
  <li>Pour batter into prepared crust. Place pan on a foil-lined cookie sheet to catch any leaks.</li>
  <li>Bake on the center rack for 50–60 minutes, or until the center is jiggly but not liquid. Edges may be slightly puffed and golden.</li>
  <li>Remove from oven and let cool on top of the oven for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge to loosen.</li>
  <li>Cool at room temperature for 1–2 hours, then refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight until fully chilled and firm.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ice Cream Layer:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Once cheesecake is fully chilled, remove from springform pan and set aside.</li>
  <li>Clean the springform pan and line it with parchment paper or plastic wrap for easy removal.</li>
  <li>Spread softened ice cream evenly into the bottom of the lined springform pan. Smooth the top.</li>
  <li>Freeze for 1–2 hours, or until the ice cream is firm.</li>
  <li>Carefully place the chilled cheesecake on top of the ice cream layer inside the pan. Press gently to level.</li>
  <li>Return to the freezer and freeze at least 4 hours or overnight until cake is fully set.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To Serve:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Remove cake from freezer and let sit at room temperature for 5–10 minutes before slicing.</li>
  <li>Top with whipped cream, sauce, berries, or other desired toppings. Slice and enjoy!</li>
