<h1>The Best Steak Recipe</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>1 1/2 thick-cut steak (Ribeye or New York Strip)</li>
  <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>High smoke point oil (vegetable, canola, or avocado oil)</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
  <li>Fresh Hrebs like rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
  <li>Garlic cloves, smashed (optional)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preparation</li>
  <li>
    Allow the steak to come to room temperature for 30-45 minutes. This helps ensure even cooking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This is crucial for achieving a good sear.
  </li>
  <li>
    Season both sides of the steak generously with salt and pepper.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Pan Searing</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat until it's very hot and shimmering.
  </li>
  <li>Add a few tablespoons of high smoke point oil to the hot skillet.</li>
  <li>
    Carefully place the steak in the hot pan. You should hear it sizzle immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sear the first side without moving it for about 3-4 minutes, or until a deep brown crust develops.
  </li>
  <li>
    Flip the steak and sear the other side for the same amount of time.
  </li>
  <li>
    For thicker cuts, use tongs to sear the edges by holding the steak upright on its sides.
  </li>
  <h3>Finishing</h3>
  <li>
    Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the butter to the skillet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add fresh herbs and smashed garlic cloves to the pan.
  </li>
  <li>Once the butter is melted, tilt the skillet and use a spoon to baste the steak with the melted butter, herbs, and garlic.</li>
  <li>Continue basting until the steak reaches your desired internal temperature. Use a meat thermometer to ensure accuracy. Note that the internal temperature will continue to rise a few degrees after removing the steak from the heat.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Medium-rare: 120-125°F (130°F when served)</li>
        <li>Medium: 130-135°F (140°F when served)</li>
        <li>Medium-well: 140-145°F (150°F when served)</li>
        <li>Well done: 150-155°F (160°F when served)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Resting</h3>
  <li>
    Transfer the cooked steak to a plate or cutting board.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tent loosely with aluminum foil and let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender and juicy steak.
  </li>
<h3>Serving</h3>
  <li>
    Slice the steak against the grain (perpendicular to the lines in the meat).
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve immediately, perhaps with the leftover butter and herbs from the pan.  </li>
</ol>
