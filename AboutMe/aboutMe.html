            About Me
        </h3>
        <p>Born january 19 of the year 2000 in the capital of Ecuator known as quito</p>
    
        <p>     Graduated with a computer science associates and decided to continue my eduacation into 
            computer systems with a development focus. There isnt much to me other than School,work,and family. 
            The reason I joined the ttpr is to sharpen the tools that I've been able to learn through my time as a student. 
            But I hope to learn a lot more about the field that I want to choose and work in since most of what i know about 
            development is theoretical not quite practical.</p>
